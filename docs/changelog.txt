Dtella Changelog

1.0.x (TBD):
- Enabled the logging of messages and errors to a file.
- Added a --port command-line option for specifying a custom TCP port.
- Fixed a bug in the progress bar, where it was possible for the sync to
complete before reaching 100%.
- Fixed a bug which could cause a node to request extra bridge blocks.

1.0.4 (2007-03-08):
- Added the ability to whitelist an IP for running an offcampus bridge or
cache node (search and file transfer requests are still filtered.)
- bugfix: 'No Online Nodes' case wasn't working right
- bugfix: Sometimes 'Sync Complete' would fire twice in a row.
- Made the state handling code more modular.

1.0.3 (2007-02-27):
- Made the topic formatting more URL-friendly. (i.e. no quotes)
- Added a workaround for the DNSQueryTimeoutError bug in Twisted.

1.0.2 (2007-02-26):
- Faster network sync algorithm.
- Improved detection of broken port forwards.
- Fixed a few random bugs.
- Theoretically better error handling during DNS requests.

1.0.1 (2007-02-18):
- Fixed the "node_ipps" bug.
- Fixed the fixable part of the "malformed address" bug.

1.0.0 (2007-02-16):
- New bitmap and icon for installer.
- Catch exceptions raised by setTcpNoDelay
- Fix support for some older clients (like StrongDC 1.0) that send $MyINFO
before $GetNickList.
- More agressive sending of NF (Node Failure) messages during the last hop to
a failed node.  This should help somewhat to prevent random dropouts.

0.9.3 (2007-02-15):
- Added support for +m (moderated) mode
- Fixed typo which caused an error if !users run while offline.
- bugfix: a failed DNS reply was sometimes tagged as a success; this resulted
in all the bridge traffic becoming invisible

an invalid file transfer request.

- Simplified the ChatMessageSequencer code

0.9.1 (2007-02-09):
- added new commands: !terminate, !localsearch, !version
