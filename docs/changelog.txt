Dtella Changelog

1.0.0 (2007-02-16):
- New bitmap and icon for installer.
- Catch exceptions raised by setTcpNoDelay
- Fix support for some older clients (like StrongDC 1.0) that send $MyINFO
before $GetNickList.
- More agressive sending of NF (Node Failure) messages during the last hop to
a failed node.  This should help somewhat to prevent random dropouts.

0.9.3 (2007-02-15):
- Added support for +m (moderated) mode
- Fixed typo which caused an error if !users run while offline.

in all the bridge traffic becoming invisible
- In uninstaller, removal of dtella.state is now optional.
- "Kill Dtella" link has its own icon now.
- If a DNS query fails, it will now try again periodically while online.

- bugfix: Wasn't trying to reconnect after a connection failure.
- bugfix: Connection didn't proceed in the event of a DNS failure.

an invalid file transfer request.
