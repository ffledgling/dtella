This file consists of my random sketches of how the Dtella protocol might work.
Note that it's basically my brainstorming dump file, and parts of it are
inconsistent, outdated, incomplete, and/or nonsense.

====================================================

nickhash = md5(ipport + session_id + nick)[:4]

nickhash is used to verify that DC messages are only sent to/from
properly synchronized nodes.


Packet numbers are kept for different kinds of messages:

    - status_pktnum is used for status updates.  Any packet with a
      slightly outdated status number will get ignored by the network.
    
    - chat_pktnum is used for messages to the public chat.  If a chat
      message is received which is not exactly the previous + 1, then
      delay for a couple seconds to see if the in-sequence packet arrives.

    - general_pktnum is for everything else, because specific order doesn't
      matter much.

=============================================


Persistent nodes are nodes that stay sync'd whenever the Dtella program is open.

Nodes without a DC Client connected can specify a nick in order to keep it
reserved but invisible, so a persistent node lets you reserve your nick as
long as your computer is on.

Nonpersistent nodes will disconnect and go idle after 5 or so minutes without
a DC client.

A DC client hopping onto a sync'd node should be ready in a fraction of a
a second

Only one DC client connection permitted per Dtella node.  Other connections
to 127.0.0.1:7314 will be rejected.


=============================================)
Some routers, when sending a packet from the LAN to the router's external
IP, will give the packet a source address of the router's internal IP.
We need to detect this on login, and remap the internal IP to the external.

Send this to my own address, just as the sync is beginning:

[EC] - Echo
2-byte type = EC
8-byte random stuff

Establish a 3-second timer to receive a response.

If no response arrives, print a warning.

If the response is received from the expected address, do nothing.

If the response comes from some other IP, then any future incoming packets
from that IP should have their source IP rewritten.
    

=============================================

UDP Bootstrapping Procedure:

Send out UDP packets to lots of people, from a random port
those packets should contain your fixed UDP port, and the beginning of your
node ID

replies come back on the random port with messages like:
    - ok, pinged normal port
    - if IP invalid, but key correct, "bad IP"
    - otherwise, no reply

When an "ok" is sent to the random port, also send to the normal port:
    - if pinged node isn't sync'd, reply with a packet full of other IPs to try
    - if it is sync'd reply with:
        * your ID+IP
        * ID+IP+Port for the 16 closest online nodes

Need some sort of heuristic to determine when UDP port isn't forwarded properly
If we get lots of OK's, but never get a reply on the normal port, then
something's wrong.

Establish neighbor connections with the first 3 available "closest" nodes

=============================================

Distributed Sync Algorithm:

- set of uncontacted nodes
- set of contated nodes

Every ? seconds:
    Send a sync request to an uncontacted node



=============================================

[YQ] Sync Request
2-byte type = __
6-byte sending neighbor's IPPort
1-byte hop limit
1-byte flags:
    bit 0 = timeout occurred, retransmit but don't re-forward.
6-byte src IPPort
4-byte session ID


[YR] Sync Response
2-byte type = __
6-byte src IPPort
4-byte last packet number broadcasted

2-byte expiration time
4-byte session ID
4-byte uptime
1-byte flags:
    bit0 = Node is persisitent
1-byte length + nick
1-byte length + info_string
1-byte length + topic (only nonzero if I set the topic last)

1-byte contacted neighbor count
( 6-byte neighbor's IPPort ) *
1-byte uncontacted neighbor count
( 6-byte neighbor's IPPort ) *

A contacted neighbor is either:
    - the neighbor I received your YQ from
    - a neighbor I forwarded your YQ to

=============================================

Peer discovery algorithm

Cache file stores a list:
    IPPort + Last seen UNIX time

When running, we have a heap of IPPorts, sorted by last-seen time.
The results from the DNS query have a time of now()

sentlist = {'IPPort' -> info}
info has:
    .status = {no reply, ok reply, error reply, mainport reply, timeout}
    .delayedcall = status timeout, or mainport timeout

TryOne:
    pop off node
    if it's in the "tried it" list, go back
    add node to "tried it" list
    send init packet to address
    callLater(50ms, TryOne)

received_packet_random_port:
    if 'IR':
        if .status != no reply:
            return

        increment count for My_IP in iplist

        if OK:
            .status = ok reply
            callLater(noMainPortReply, 5sec)
        if BADIP:
            .status = error reply
            ??
        if BADKEY:
            .status = error reply
            ??

received_packet_main_port:
    if .status not (no reply || ok reply):
        shouldn't happen, return.

    cancel delayedcall

    update this node's lastseen time = now

    increment count for My_IP in iplist
    
    if 'NB':
        add all neighbors to initial neighbor list
        call maybeStartConnecting()

    if 'PC':
        find maximum time value
        if maxtime > now, then subtract all times by maxtime-now
        subtract all times by 1hr
        add nodes to heap
        
maybeStartConnecting():
    increment good_count
    if good_count >= 5:
        startConnecting()
    if STARTCONNECT delayedcall doesn't exist yet:
        callLater(startConnecting, 3sec)

startConnecting():
    if STARTCONNECT delayedcall hasn't fired, cancel it

    cancel the TryOne delayedcall, to stop sending requests
    reset the node heap, put all the sentlist stuff back into it.

    determine my IP:
        count up the My_IPs in iplist, and pick the one with the most hits

    set my node ID
    look at neighbor list, sort by closeness
    every 50ms, send an "I want you" ping to a neighbor, in order of closeness

    If we have 3 neighbors:
        stop sending pings
        goto sync mode

    if we've pinged every neighbor, enter sync mode in 3 seconds?

Initial Peer Discovery packets

* [IQ] Initialize Request (send from random port)
4-byte target's IP address
2-byte my regular port


This is sent back to the dtella port:
    
* [IR] Initialize Response
6-byte my ipport (IP comes straight from the IQ)
4-byte your IP address
1-byte Response code:
    00 = Ok
    01 = IP not permitted

1-byte # of online nodes
(
6-byte IPPort
4-byte age (seconds)
)*

1-byte # of other nodes
(
6-byte IPPort
4-byte age (seconds)
)*


This is sent to the temporary port
* [IC] Initialization Peer Cache
6-byte my ipport (IP comes straight from the IQ)
4-byte your IP address
1-byte Response code:
    00 = Ok

=============================================

Node-Node communication

Node X finds its "closest" neighbors by this algorithm:
    for each N:
        distance = md5(smaller(X,N) . larger(X,N))

    sort the distance strings, and pick the lowest values

The "closeness" thing is sort of an anti-DHT.  it basically gives every node
a pseudorandom but consistent list of nodes to become neighbors with

* [PG] Ping
2-byte type = PG
6-byte src IPPort
1-byte flags:

    bit0 = the "I want you" bit.  Set if the target is one of the closest
           nodes from the perspective of the sender.  Pings should keep going
           back and forth as long as at least one node prefers the other.

    bit1 = GOTACK. "I'll accept your broadcasts"  

    bit2 = REQ (Ack Request) bit.
           This is set if ack_key contains a 4-byte ID number which is used
           in the ping AK packet.

    bit3 = ACK (Ack reply) bit.

    bit4 = NBLIST.  set if a neighbor list is included


4-byte req_key
4-byte ack_key

1-byte length
+ list of neighbors


Connection criteria:
    
    Always try stay in contact with the 3 closest nodes.

    Always stay in contact with anyone who says that we're a closest node
    to them (closeness isn't exactly symmetrical)

    If the above criteria don't result in at least 3 working connections
    then establish "I want you" connections with the next closest nodes
    until a minimum of 3 good connections exist.
