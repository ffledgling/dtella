If you run into any roadblocks, you can go to dtella.org and
click [IRC] to chat with all the Dtella users from your browser.

When you start Dtella, it just runs invisibly in the background.
In order to accomplish anything useful, you'll have to connect to it
with a DC client.  The most common one is DC++:

http://www.dcpp.net/

Create a favorite hub in DC++ with these options:
> Name:    Dtella
> Address: 127.0.0.1:7314

Dtella needs a UDP port for peer communication, and DC++ needs
a TCP port for file transfers.  If you have a firewall or router
that's blocking ports, then check out these guides:

Once you're on, you'll have to share some files unless you just
want to chat.  In DC++, go here to get started:

File > Settings > Sharing

Type !help into the main chat to see a list of Dtella commands.
